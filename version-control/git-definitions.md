# Git Definitions

**Instructions: ** Define each of the following Git concepts.

* What is version control?  Why is it useful?
Version control is a system that records changes to a file over time so that you can recall specific versions later. It allows you to keep track of your work at scale.

* What is a branch and why would you use one?
It is an isolated replica of the orginal (master branch) code base

* What is a commit? What makes a good commit message?
A commit is a change to the code base. A good commit message is descriptive and specific.

* What is a merge conflict?
It is when two code bases have been edited differently and need to be consolidated into 1 file.
